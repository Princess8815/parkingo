## Setup Instructions

### Basic Setup (Offline Mode)

The game works out-of-the-box in offline mode with no additional setup required.

### Firebase Setup for Multiplayer (Optional)

1. **Create a Firebase Project**

   - Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Click "Create a project"
   - Follow the setup wizard

2. **Enable Realtime Database**

   - In your Firebase console, go to "Realtime Database"
   - Click "Create Database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" for development

3. **Get Your Configuration**

   - Go to Project Settings > General
   - Scroll down to "Your apps" and click the web icon
   - Copy the Firebase configuration object

4. **Configure the Game**

   - Open `pages/room-setup.html`
   - Replace the empty `firebaseConfig` object with your configuration:

   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
     authDomain: 'your-project.firebaseapp.com',
     databaseURL: 'https://your-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/',
     projectId: 'your-project-id',
     storageBucket: 'your-project.appspot.com',
     messagingSenderId: '123456789',
     appId: 'your-app-id',
   }
   ```

   - Do the same in `pages/game.html`

5. **Set Database Rules** (for development)
   In Firebase Console > Realtime Database > Rules, set:
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       ".read": true,
       ".write": true
     }
   }
   ```
   **⚠️ Note: These rules allow anyone to read/write. Use proper security rules for production!**
